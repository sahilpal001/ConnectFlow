# 🌐 ConnectFlow: Animated Network Routing Simulator

ConnectFlow is a Python-powered, interactive network simulator that visualizes how data packets are routed across a network of routers using Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm. Built using Streamlit, **NetworkX, and **Matplotlib, it offers an animated and intuitive understanding of how real-world routing works.
